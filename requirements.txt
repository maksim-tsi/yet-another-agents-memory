# This file contains the Python dependencies for the Hybrid Memory System project.
# To install, run: pip install -r requirements.txt

# --- Core Frameworks & Data Validation ---
pydantic==2.8.2          # For data validation, settings management, and defining our data schemas.

# --- Operating Memory Layer (Redis) ---
redis==5.0.7             # The official Python client for Redis.

# PostgreSQL Async Driver
# Note: asyncpg requires compilation. If you encounter build errors:
# Option 1 (Recommended): Use psycopg[binary] instead
# Option 2: Ensure build tools are installed: apt-get install build-essential python3-dev
# For Python 3.13, we use psycopg with binary wheels (works with Python 3.13)
psycopg[binary]>=3.2.0  # PostgreSQL adapter with binary wheels (works with Python 3.13)

# --- Persistent Knowledge Layer (Specialized Databases) ---

# Vector Store Client
qdrant-client==1.9.2     # The official Python client for the Qdrant vector database.
sentence-transformers==3.0.1 # Used for creating high-quality sentence/text embeddings.
# Note: sentence-transformers will pull in PyTorch, transformers, etc.

# Graph Store Client
neo4j==5.22.0            # The official Python driver for the Neo4j graph database.

# Search Store Client
meilisearch==0.28.0      # The official Python client for the Meilisearch engine.

# --- Development & Testing Utilities ---
fakeredis==2.23.1        # A mock Redis client, useful for running tests without a live Redis server.
# Note: For the __main__ demo block in memory_system.py to run self-contained.
