For the "Standard RAG Agent" baseline, a full data dictionary is simpler, but it's still a critical document for defining the experiment's constraints.

The key difference is that for this run, we are not using our custom Pydantic models (`PersonalMemoryState`, `SharedWorkspaceState`) because the entire concept of a structured operating memory is intentionally disabled. The "data" flowing through the system is much simpler.

Here is the Data Dictionary for the second benchmark run (UC-02).

### **Data Dictionary: Standard RAG Agent Baseline**

**Document ID:** DD-02
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 14, 2025

#### **1. Object: `BenchmarkTurnPayload`**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Object Name:** | `BenchmarkTurnPayload` |
| **Description:** | A simple JSON object representing the input from the Benchmark Runner to the MAS for a single conversational turn. It contains the full context and the current user message. |
| **Physical Storage:** | Transient; exists only for the duration of the HTTP request from the Benchmark Runner to the Agent Wrapper. |

| Field Name | Data Type | Constraints / Example | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `history` | `string` | `"User: Hi\nAI: Hello!\nUser: What is..."` | The complete, concatenated text of the entire conversation history up to the current turn. | **Yes** |
| `message` | `string` | `"Can you tell me more about that?"` | The most recent user message that the agent must respond to. | **Yes** |

---

#### **2. Object: `QdrantDocument`**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Object Name:** | `QdrantDocument` |
| **Description:** | The data structure for a single document stored in the persistent vector store (Qdrant). For this baseline, each "document" represents a single, complete conversational turn. |
| **Physical Storage:** | Stored as a point with a payload in the **Qdrant** collection on the Data Node. The collection is named `goodai_ltm_full_history`. |

| Field Name | Data Type | Constraints / Example | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` (UUID) | `uuid.uuid4()` | A unique identifier for the document point in Qdrant. | **Yes** |
| `content` | `string` | `"User: What is your name?\nAI: My name is AI."` | The concatenated text of a single user-AI exchange. This field is vectorized for semantic search. | **Yes** |
| `turn_number` | `integer` | `42` | The sequential index of this turn within the conversation. Useful for metadata filtering if needed. | **Yes** |
| `timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 Datetime) | `2025-09-14T18:30:00.123Z` | The timestamp of when this turn occurred or was indexed. | **Yes** |

### **Summary of Key Differences from the "Full System" Data Dictionary:**

*   **Absence of `PersonalMemoryState` and `SharedWorkspaceState`:** This is the most critical point. The data dictionary for this run is defined by what it *lacks*. There are no formal data structures for an agent's internal state or for a collaborative workspace, because the baseline architecture does not have these concepts.
*   **Simpler Data Flow:** The only data objects are the initial input (`BenchmarkTurnPayload`) and the final storage format (`QdrantDocument`). This reflects the simple, stateless "retrieve-then-read" workflow of the RAG agent.
*   **"Dumb" Persistence:** The `QdrantDocument` simply stores the raw conversational turn. There is no concept of "distilled knowledge" or structured, multi-modal archiving. All knowledge is treated as unstructured text.

This Data Dictionary, when read alongside the one for the Full System, provides a clear and formal specification of the architectural differences we are testing in our experiment. It makes the comparison precise and unambiguous.
