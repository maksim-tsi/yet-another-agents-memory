Verify connectivity:

```zsh
curl "$QDRANT_URL" | grep -i title
curl "$TYPESENSE_URL/health"
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" PING
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" -c "SELECT 1;"
```

## Credentials

- **Managed via `.env` file in repository root (NOT committed to public repo)**
- Required environment variables:
  - `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
  - `NEO4J_USER` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD`
  - `TYPESENSE_API_KEY`
- See `.env.example` for template
