# Plans Index

This directory contains execution plans and RFP-style planning documents for YAAM.
Plans are treated as first-class, versioned artifacts to support agent-first development and
progressive disclosure of repository knowledge.

## Active planning artifacts

- `docs/plan/rfp-repository-harness-and-skills-v1.md` — Request for proposal describing the scope,
  goals, and non-goals for repository harness hardening and Skills v1 (feedback-only benchmark posture).
- `docs/plan/adr010-implementation-plan-repository-harness-and-skills-v1.md` — Implementation plan for
  ADR-010 (workstreams, milestones, acceptance criteria).

## Conventions

- Short, actionable, evidence-oriented steps are preferred over broad narratives.
- Plans should link to relevant ADRs and specs rather than duplicating them.
