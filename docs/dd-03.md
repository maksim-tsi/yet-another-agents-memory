This document is intentionally simple. Its simplicity is a key part of the story, as it formally documents the brute-force, unstructured nature of this baseline's "memory." When compared to the data dictionary for our full system, it starkly illustrates the architectural differences.

### **Data Dictionary: Full-Context Agent Baseline**

**Document ID:** DD-03
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 14, 2025

#### **1. Object: `BenchmarkTurnPayload`**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Object Name:** | `BenchmarkTurnPayload` |
| **Description:** | A simple JSON object representing the input from the Benchmark Runner to the MAS for a single conversational turn. It contains the full context and the current user message. |
| **Physical Storage:** | Transient; exists only for the duration of the HTTP request from the Benchmark Runner to the Agent Wrapper. |

| Field Name | Data Type | Constraints / Example | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `history` | `string` | `"User: Hi\nAI: Hello!\nUser: What is..."` | The complete, concatenated text of the entire conversation history up to the current turn. | **Yes** |
| `message` | `string` | `"Can you tell me more about that?"` | The most recent user message that the agent must respond to. | **Yes** |

#### **2. Object: `ConversationHistoryLog`**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Object Name:** | `ConversationHistoryLog` |
| **Description:** | A single, unstructured text block representing the entire linear history of a conversation. It serves as the agent's sole source of memory and is retrieved in its entirety for every conversational turn. It contains no structured metadata or distilled insights. |
| **Physical Storage:** | Stored as a single `STRING` value in the **Operating Memory (Redis)**. The key follows the format `full_history:{conversation_id}`. |

| Field Name | Data Type | Constraints / Example | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `raw_text` | `string` | `"User: What is your name?\nAI: My name is AI.\nUser: ..."` | The complete, undifferentiated text of the conversation. Each new turn (user message and AI response) is appended to the end of this string. | **Yes** |

### **Summary of Key Differences from Other Data Dictionaries:**

*   **Absence of All Structured Memory Objects:** This data model contains no `PersonalMemoryState`, `SharedWorkspaceState`, `QdrantDocument`, or any other structured object. This is by design, as the baseline lacks any concept of a structured memory architecture.
*   **Unstructured, Monolithic Memory:** The `ConversationHistoryLog` represents a single, monolithic block of memory. Unlike the full system which separates and structures knowledge, this baseline treats all information as a simple, linear sequence of text.
*   **No Lifecycle Data:** There are no fields for `promotion_candidates`, `status`, or any other metadata related to an information lifecycle. The data is simply recorded; it is not managed, curated, or distilled.

This Data Dictionary completes the full set of engineering documents for our three experimental runs. We now have a comprehensive, unambiguous specification for each test condition.
