This document provides the formal "ground truth" for the structure of the information flowing through our system. It is the definitive specification for our Pydantic models, ensuring that all agents and system components are speaking the same language. This prevents data-related bugs and makes the entire system more robust and easier to debug.

Here is the Data Dictionary, focusing on the key data objects used in the GoodAI LTM Benchmark run (UC-01).

### **Data Dictionary: Hybrid Memory System**

**Document ID:** DD-01
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 14, 2025

#### **1. Object: `PersonalMemoryState`**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Object Name:** | `PersonalMemoryState` |
| **Description:** | Represents the private, transient state of a single agent. This object encapsulates the agent's internal "thoughts," intermediate calculations, and data staged for potential long-term storage. It is designed to be frequently read and overwritten within a single task. |
| **Physical Storage:** | Serialized to a JSON string and stored as the value of a single key in the **Operating Memory (Redis)**. The key follows the format `personal_state:{agent_id}`. |

| Field Name | Data Type | Constraints / Example | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `agent_id` | `string` | `planner_agent_001` | The unique, machine-readable identifier for the agent that owns this state object. | **Yes** |
| `current_task_id` | `string` (Optional) | `goodai_test_case_42` | An identifier for the high-level task the agent is currently focused on. Useful for logging and observability. | No |
| `scratchpad` | `JSON Object` (Dict[str, Any]) | `{"status": "retrieving", "query": "..."}` | A volatile key-value store for the agent's intermediate calculations, internal monologue (Chain-of-Thought), or temporary data. This is the agent's primary "thinking" space. | No (defaults to `{}`) |
| `promotion_candidates` | `JSON Object` (Dict[str, Any]) | `{"insight_1": {"content": "User prefers shipping via Port of Hamburg", "confidence": 0.95}}` | A staging area for pieces of information that the agent has deemed potentially valuable for long-term storage. The ConsolidationAgent will evaluate the contents of this field against the EPDL/Consolidation logic. | No (defaults to `{}`) |
| `last_updated` | `string` (ISO 8601 Datetime) | `2025-09-14T18:30:00.123Z` | An automatically managed timestamp indicating when this state object was last written to Redis. | **Yes** (auto-set) |

---

#### **2. Object: `SharedWorkspaceState`**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Object Name:** | `SharedWorkspaceState` |
| **Description:** | Represents the shared, collaborative state for a single, multi-agent task or event. It serves as the centralized "negotiation table" and source of truth for all agents participating in the resolution of that event. |
| **Physical Storage:** | Serialized to a JSON string and stored as the value of a single key in the **Operating Memory (Redis)**. The key follows the format `shared_state:{event_id}`. |

| Field Name | Data Type | Constraints / Example | Description | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `event_id` | `string` | `evt_a1b2c3d4e5` | A unique identifier for this collaborative event, typically a UUID. | **Yes** (auto-set) |
| `status` | `string` | `active`, `resolved`, `cancelled` | The current status of the collaborative event. Drives agent behavior and triggers the Archiving process when set to a terminal state. | **Yes** |
| `shared_data` | `JSON Object` (Dict[str, Any]) | `{"alert": "Vessel V-123 delayed", "port_congestion": 0.91}` | The core data for the event. This is the "whiteboard" where all agents read and write shared facts and state information. | No (defaults to `{}`) |
| `participating_agents` | `Array of strings` | `["vessel_agent_123", "port_agent_007"]` | A log of the `agent_id`s of all agents that have contributed to this event. Useful for attribution and auditing. | No (defaults to `[]`) |
| `created_at` | `string` (ISO 8601 Datetime) | `2025-09-14T18:00:00.000Z` | Timestamp of when the event was first created. | **Yes** (auto-set) |
| `last_updated` | `string` (ISO 8601 Datetime) | `2025-09-14T18:45:10.500Z` | Timestamp of the last modification to this event's state. | **Yes** (auto-set) |

### **How These Documents Form a Coherent Whole**

With these three artifacts, we now have a complete and unambiguous specification for the benchmark run:

1.  The **Use Case Specification** describes the narrative flow and high-level requirements.
2.  The **Sequence Diagram** visualizes the precise, time-ordered interactions between system components that execute that narrative.
3.  This **Data Dictionary** defines the exact structure and meaning of the data objects (`PersonalMemoryState`, `SharedWorkspaceState`) that are passed as messages in that sequence diagram.

An engineer can now take these three documents and implement the benchmark test with a very high degree of confidence that the final code will perfectly match our architectural design.
