# Logs Directory

This directory contains runtime logs and trace artifacts generated during local runs and tests.
These files are gitignored to avoid noisy churn and unintentional disclosure of transient data.
If a log file is needed for analysis or reporting, attach it explicitly to the relevant issue or documentation entry.
