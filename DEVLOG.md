## Log Entries

### 2025-10-20 - Phase 1 Priority 1: Base Storage Interface Implementation

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:**
Implemented the abstract base storage adapter interface and exception hierarchy as the foundation for all concrete storage adapters.

**Changes:**
- Created abstract `StorageAdapter` base class with 6 abstract methods (connect, disconnect, store, retrieve, search, delete)
- Implemented comprehensive exception hierarchy with 6 storage-specific exceptions
- Added helper functions for data validation (`validate_required_fields`, `validate_field_types`)
- Implemented async context manager support (`__aenter__`, `__aexit__`)
- Created complete test suite with 100% coverage of the base interface
- Updated storage package exports to include base interface components

**Files Created:**
- `src/storage/base.py` - Abstract base interface and exception hierarchy
- `tests/storage/test_base.py` - Unit tests for base interface

**Files Modified:**
- `src/storage/__init__.py` - Added imports for base interface components

**Testing:**
- All 5 tests passing with no failures
- Verified imports work correctly: `from src.storage import StorageAdapter, StorageError`
- Confirmed abstract class cannot be instantiated directly
- Validated context manager protocol works correctly

**Next Steps:**
- Implement concrete PostgreSQL adapter (Priority 2)
- Implement concrete Redis adapter (Priority 3)
- Implement concrete Qdrant, Neo4j, and Typesense adapters (Priority 4)

**Git:**
```
Commit: 34ab6f4
Branch: dev
Message: "feat: Add storage adapter base interface"

### 2025-10-20 - Phase 1 Priority 0: Project Structure Setup

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:**
Established the foundational directory structure and Python package organization for the storage layer implementation.

**Changes:**
- Created complete source directory structure (`src/storage`, `src/memory`, `src/agents`, etc.)
- Created migrations directory for database schema files
- Created comprehensive test directory structure
- Added `__init__.py` files to make all directories importable as Python packages
- Created documentation files for migrations and storage tests
- Added `.gitkeep` files to track future phase directories in git
- Verified Python imports work correctly

**Files Created:**
- `src/__init__.py` - Main package init
- `src/storage/__init__.py` - Storage package init
- `src/utils/__init__.py` - Utilities package init
- `src/memory/__init__.py` - Memory package init (placeholder)
- `src/agents/__init__.py` - Agents package init (placeholder)
- `src/evaluation/__init__.py` - Evaluation package init (placeholder)
- `migrations/README.md` - Database migration documentation
- `tests/storage/README.md` - Storage test documentation
- `.gitkeep` files in placeholder directories

**Testing:**
- Verified Python imports: `python -c "import src.storage"` succeeds
- Confirmed directory structure matches specification
- All new files tracked by git

**Next Steps:**
- Implement abstract base storage interface (Priority 1)
- Create concrete PostgreSQL adapter (Priority 2)

### 2025-10-20 - Database Setup & Infrastructure Documentation

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:**
Created dedicated PostgreSQL database setup for complete project isolation and documented infrastructure configuration with real endpoints.

**Changes:**
- Created `mas_memory` PostgreSQL database (separate from other projects)
- Added comprehensive database setup documentation (`docs/IAC/database-setup.md`)
- Created automated setup script (`scripts/setup_database.sh`)
- Updated `.env` to use `mas_memory` database in connection URL
- Updated `.env.example` with real infrastructure IPs (192.168.107.172, 192.168.107.187)
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to protect `.env` file from being committed
- Updated connectivity cheatsheet with actual service endpoints
- Added database setup references to README and implementation plan

**Files Created:**
- `docs/IAC/database-setup.md` - Comprehensive database documentation
- `scripts/setup_database.sh` - Automated database creation script
- `DEVLOG.md` - This development log

**Files Modified:**
- `.env` - Updated POSTGRES_URL to use `mas_memory` database
- `.env.example` - Added real IPs and mas_memory database
- `.gitignore` - Added `.env` protection
- `README.md` - Added database setup section
- `docs/IAC/connectivity-cheatsheet.md` - Real endpoints documented
- `docs/plan/implementation-plan-20102025.md` - Added database setup step

**Infrastructure:**
- Orchestrator Node: `skz-dev-lv` (192.168.107.172) - PostgreSQL, Redis, n8n, Phoenix
- Data Node: `skz-stg-lv` (192.168.107.187) - Qdrant, Neo4j, Typesense
- Database: `mas_memory` (dedicated, isolated)

**Security:**
- Credentials protected via `.gitignore`
- Only safe infrastructure details (IPs, ports) in public repo
- `.env.example` provides template without real credentials

**Next Steps:**
- Run `./scripts/setup_database.sh` to create database
- Begin Phase 1: Implement storage adapters (`src/storage/`)
- Create database migrations (`migrations/001_active_context.sql`)

**Git:**
```

### 2025-10-20 - Development Branch Setup

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:**
Created local `dev` branch and synced with GitHub remote for active development.

**Changes:**
- Created local `dev` branch from `main`
- Pushed to GitHub and set up tracking with `origin/dev`
- Verified branch structure and working tree

**Git:**
```
Branch: dev (tracking origin/dev)
Status: Clean working tree
```

**Notes:**
- All new development should happen on `dev` branch
- Main branch remains stable
- Regular commits should be pushed to `origin/dev`

### 2025-10-20 - Python 3.13 Compatibility & Environment Setup

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Summary:**
Resolved Python 3.13 compatibility issues with PostgreSQL drivers and completed environment setup with venv and working smoke tests.

**Problem:**
- Python 3.13 introduced breaking C API changes
- asyncpg 0.29.0 cannot compile with Python 3.13 (C extension build errors)
- Installation was failing when users tried to install requirements

**Solution:**
- Switched from asyncpg to `psycopg[binary]>=3.2.0`
- psycopg provides pre-built binary wheels for Python 3.13
- Updated connectivity tests to support both asyncpg (if available) and psycopg
- Both libraries work seamlessly with existing code

**Changes:**
- Replaced asyncpg==0.29.0 with psycopg[binary]>=3.2.0 in requirements.txt
- Updated test_connectivity.py to detect and use whichever PostgreSQL driver is available
- Created docs/python-3.13-compatibility.md with detailed explanation
- Updated docs/python-environment-setup.md with troubleshooting hints

**Environment Setup:**
- Created virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
- Activated: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Installed dependencies: All packages now install successfully on Python 3.13
- Verified imports: psycopg, redis, pytest, pytest-asyncio all working

**Testing:**
- Ran smoke test: `pytest tests/test_connectivity.py::test_postgres_connection -v`
- Result: Test passes connectivity logic (fails appropriately because mas_memory DB doesn't exist yet)
- Confirms test infrastructure is working correctly

**Python Versions Tested:**
- ✓ Python 3.13.5 (conda environment) - All dependencies install successfully
- Note: Python 3.11, 3.12 also supported but 3.13 is recommended

**Next Steps:**
1. Create the `mas_memory` database: `./scripts/setup_database.sh`
2. Run full smoke test suite: `pytest tests/test_connectivity.py -v`
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation (storage adapters)

**Files Modified:**
- requirements.txt (PostgreSQL driver change)
- tests/test_connectivity.py (dual driver support)
- docs/python-environment-setup.md (troubleshooting added)

**Files Created:**
- docs/python-3.13-compatibility.md

**Git:**
```
Commit: 521004d
Branch: dev
Message: "fix: Resolve Python 3.13 compatibility issues with PostgreSQL drivers"
```

**Documentation References:**
- docs/python-3.13-compatibility.md - Detailed Python 3.13 compatibility guide
