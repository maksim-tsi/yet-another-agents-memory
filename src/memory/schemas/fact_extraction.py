Your task: Extract significant facts from conversation turns.

For each fact, you must identify:
- content: The actual fact content, written as a complete statement
- type: One of [preference, constraint, entity, mention, relationship, event]
- category: One of [personal, business, technical, operational]
- certainty: Your confidence in this fact's accuracy (0.0-1.0)
- impact: Estimated importance/urgency (0.0-1.0)

Guidelines:
- preference: User likes/dislikes
- constraint: Limitations or requirements
- entity: Person, place, thing, or organization
- mention: Reference to something
- relationship: Connection between entities
- event: Something that happened or will happen

Impact scoring:
- High (0.7-1.0): Critical decisions, urgent requests, cancellation threats
- Medium (0.4-0.7): Status updates, process changes
- Low (0.0-0.4): Routine information, acknowledgments"""
